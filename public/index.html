		<h2>Javascript, the bad parts, and how to avoid them?</h2>

		<h4>Types</h4>
		<p>Sadly, and probably the worst choice ever made about JS, is that it’s weakly typed. Variables are untyped, only
			values are, and what types are they ? It’s either Object, Symbol, String, Number, Boolean, Null (yeah), and
			Undefined (yeah, undefined is a type of his own). What’s even kind of ridiculous is that when you test that your
			variable is an object, you have to do this : </p>
		<em> if (typeof myObject === "object" && myObject !== null)</em>

		<p> Because your object can be of type Object, and still be null you know.
			And this weakly thing really is a pain because without types, the code is damn obscure.</p>

		<h4>Numbers</h4>
		<p> It’s terrible that numbers in javascript are double-precision floating points (i’ll talk about it in an article
			dedicated to representations). Which means you have no integer type. What’s the problem with it ? Just watch.</p>

		<em> Yeah, 0.1 + 0.2 is equal to 0.300…4. And well, this is terrible when you want to check 0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3
			because, in
			JS, it turns out it isn’t.</em>

		<p>Once again, to explain this, i’ll have to talk a lot about how floating numbers are represented in a computer, so
			for
			now just know this is barely the type of the icerberg.</p>
